title: Date - Selection Advices
---

Sometimes, you may need to select a date from a calendar which is (far) away from the current date position.<br />
To achieve faster date selection, clicking on header of dater picker to go in wider time range for selection.

Examples by clicking on header of date picker.

When datepicker opens:
<img src={uiUxPatternDatepickerCurrent.src} alt="ui-ux-pattern-date-current-link" />

Click on "February 2025" to go one level up:
<img src={uiUxPatternDatepickerCurrentOneLevelUp.src} alt="ui-ux-pattern-date-current-one-level-up-link" />

Click on "2025" to go another level up:
<img src={uiUxPatternDatepickerCurrentTwoLevelUp.src} alt="ui-ux-pattern-date-current-two-level-up-link" />

Click on "2020-2029" to go another level up:
<img src={uiUxPatternDatepickerCurrentThreeLevelUp.src} alt="ui-ux-pattern-date-current-three-level-up-link" />

When selecting option below header, date picker goes in "lower" datetime range again.

:::tip
This patterns also apply to datetime picker.
