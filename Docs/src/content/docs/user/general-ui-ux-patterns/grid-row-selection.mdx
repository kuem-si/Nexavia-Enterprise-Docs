title: Grid - Row Selection
---

Some grids may have enabled row selection feature (based on desired functionality of specific part of application).
The possible srow selection modes are:
- single
- multiple

:::tip
When selection of multiple rows are enabled, **Select all** checkbox <u>may appear</u> as the first column in the grid.<br /><br />
**IMPORTANT**<br />
**Select all** feature may also be not available due to technical reasons (possibility of too many selected rows in the grid for further manipulation,...).
:::

Example of the grid with enabled multiple selection and **Select all** feature:
<img src={uiUxPatternGridRowSelectionMultipleSelectAll.src} alt="ui-ux-pattern-grid-row-selection-multiple-select-all-link" />

:::caution
**Select all** feature for selecting rows can be configured in two modes:<br />
- select all rows <u>inside current grid page</u>
- select all rows <u>globally (on all pages)</u>

Based on specific functionality of grid inside application, the most appropriate mode is chosen.<br />
<u>User can always manually check mode of **Select all** feature if go one page forward (or back) inside grid.</u>
:::

:::tip
When multiple row selection mode is enabled, standard keyboard keys or combinations for selection and deselecting rows are available.

All rows between first and last one clicked are automatically selected.
