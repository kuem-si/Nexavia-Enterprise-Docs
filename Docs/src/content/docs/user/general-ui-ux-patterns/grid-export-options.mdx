## File export options in grid
The file export capabilities for grid are accessible with buttons, which are located at the upper-right corner of the grid.

The following picture below shows these buttons.

When click is made on export button (based on desired file type format), the dropdown menu for this particular button opens with the following options to select:
- Export all data
- Export selected rows

Example of dropdown menu for PDF export button:

When desired option is chosen, then exporting process starts.

When processing on the backend side is finished, file saving dialog window appears to save created file on desired storage location.

## General rules and behaviors of data exporting

:::caution
Exporting large number of rows may take a while or in some cases even fail (excessiove usage of hardware resources on backend side).<br />
Data export capabilities of the grid are not meant to be the case for large exports.<br />
<u>Large exports should be done with background workers (or jobs) on backend side or with specialized tools.</u>
:::

:::tip
When using export functionality of grid (<u>no matter which export file type</u>), the following rules applied to export file:
- when exporting "all data" it's important to understand that this means all data (rows) which are returned by backend <u>**WITH ALL APPLIED FILTERING AND SORTING**</u> (row filter,...) in application.
- columns that are visible in grid (hidden columns inside column chooser are not exported to file)
- column order inside exported file are the same as in application
:::

:::caution
When exporting to CSV file, it's important to define delimiter that cannot be broke by some data in some column.<br />
<u>**The best delimiter is unique character that cannot appear in any column (data).**</u><br />
<u>When this rule is not satisfied, the broken CSV file is created.</u>
