title: Chart - Export & Print Options
---

Regardless of chart visual type (bar chart, line chart,...), the export and print options are the same.

:::caution
Based on technical reasons, not all options (e.g. print) or file formats for export are available on every chart inside application.
:::

Export and Print options are available at the upper-right corner of chart when clicking button with three horizontal lines (as shown on the picture below):

<img src={uiUxPatternChartExportPrintOptions.src} alt="ui-ux-pattern-chart-export-print-options-link" />

Supported export file types are: **PNG**, **PDF**, **JPEG**, **SVG** and **GIF**

:::tip
Exporting and Printing capabilities for chart always creates the same picture of chart which is shown at the time of exporting/printing.<br />
<u>If some series types (lines, bar series,...) are hidden on the chart, it will also not be visible on exported/printed asset.</u>
:::

When printing option is selected, standard printing window dialog of operating systems is opened.

When file export option is selected (regardless of file type), standard file saving windows dialog of operating systems is opened.
