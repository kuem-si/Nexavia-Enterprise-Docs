Overview of concepts and best practices for pairing IoT devices with application.

Every **Device Type** that has decoder gets default base for code which follows convention

```
[device_manufacturer_company]-[device-model-name-and-potential-version]-[firmware-version]
```
Example of default base code for [Senzemo Senspuck SPU10B](/user/device-management/supported-iot-devices#senspuck-spu10b)
```
sensedge-senspuck-spu10b-v001
```
<hr />

## Naming convention schemas recommendations
**It's highly recommended that you define strict and well-described naming conventions for your different
device types which are in use inside your tenant!**

Well-defined naming convention saves a lot of time when establishing IoT sensor ecosystem for your tenant and prevents
debugging why there is no decoded data for specific device in application.

Few examples of good naming convention schemas for **specific device**:
```
[device_manufacturer_company]-[device-model-name-and-potential-version]-[sequence-number]
[device_manufacturer_company]-[device-model-name-and-potential-version]-[serial-number]
```

:::tip
It's recommended that **firmware version** is not part of naming convention scheme for production installed device.<br />
When device is flashed with new major firmware version, <u>device name remains the same</u>.<br />
It's also a misleading name if there is a different firmware version in a specific device name as it is.
:::

:::tip
It's highly recommended that there are no UNDERSCORE characters (_) inside specific device name!

**Instead of underscore, use hyphen/dash (-) or *at* sign (@) (preferred hyphen/dash).**<br />
**Avoid also space characters in favor of hyphen/dash.**

Some network concentrators do not even allow underscore characters (like The Things Stack).

Some reverse proxies (like nginx) recogize underscore as special characters.

:::

:::tip
Don't mix uppercase and lowercase letters.<br />
Decide for lowercase or uppercase and stick with that for the whole defined naming convention.
:::

:::caution
Application does not allow inserting specific custom-defined pairing code base if this character string is already sub-string
inside other pairing code base string (on this or any other Device Type).
:::

## Automatic device recognition
**If devices are named by conventions, automatic device recognition is possible.**

It is recommended that sequence or device serial number is appended to the end of specific device name that automatic device recognition works.

Example for specific device name for device type **Senzemo Senspuck SPU10B** based on default code:
```
sensedge-senspuck-spu10b-v001-0000025
```
Instead of sequence number, you can use serial number or something different that is unique.
Example:
```
sensedge-senspuck-spu10b-v001-[serial-number]
or
sensedge-senspuck-spu10b-v001-[custom-unique-word]
```
<hr />
Decoding processing logic in the application recognizes device type *sensedge-senspuck-spu10b-v001* without any doubts and therefore also payload decoding logic.

:::caution
## Device unique name inside tenant
For specific device name (like **sensedge-senspuck-spu10b-v001-0000025**) is not guaranteed that is 100% unique in application!

Specific devices are uniquely determined by **Network Concentrator instance id/name** and **specific device name**.

Reasons for such design decision: It is not possible to prevent that one specific device (with specific name) is connected to multiple network
concentrators (more specific instances of network concentrators) and configured that all network concentrators with this specific device forward data to
the same tenant in the application.
:::

:::caution
## Major device type firmware updates
Sometimes specific **device type** receives major firmware update, which changes the payload structure.<br />
Therefore, some device types have multiple versions, which are defined on [Supported IoT Devices](/user/device-management/supported-iot-devices) page
with different default pairing code base.

**Specific Device Type with a major firmware update
(with a different payload structure compared to the previous firmware version) is treated as a new Device Type.**
:::

<hr />

## Applying additional pairing code base for Device Type

**It is possible to assign one or more different pairing code bases for specific Device Type.**

:::tip
It's recommended that for the **production environment** (when IoT devices are installed on real locations) custom naming scheme
is defined <u>without firmware version</u> data and applied on relevant Device Types
<u>before first IoT devices send data</u>.
:::

When assigning a new pairing code base for device type consider:
- Read and follow [Naming convention schemas recommendations](#naming-convention-schemas-recommendations)
- **Define only one naming convention scheme if possible**
- **Be consistent with the naming scheme!**
